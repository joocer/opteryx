We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community Examples of unacceptable behavior include: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Enforcement Responsibilities Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. Scope This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via Slack (@joocer) or GitHub (@joocer). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Enforcement Guidelines Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct: 1. Correction Community Impact : Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence : A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested. 2. Warning Community Impact : A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence : A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. 3. Temporary Ban Community Impact : A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. Consequence : A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. 4. Permanent Ban Community Impact : Demonstrating a pattern of, or an extreme violation, of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. Consequence : A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

File Types Opteryx is primarily designed for use with Parquet to store data, Parquet is fast to process and offers optimizations not available for other formats, however, in some benchmarks ORC out performs Parquet. Opteryx also supports JSONL files, and JSONL files which have been Zstandard compressed ( .zstd ). .jsonl and .zstd format files are the default storage for Mabel . Opteryx also has support for Feather (Arrow) files. File Sizes Opteryx loads entire files (pages) into memory one at a time, this requires the following to be considered: Reading one record from a file loads the entire page. If you regularly only read a few records, prefer smaller pages. Reading each page, particularly from Cloud Storage (S3/GCS), incurs a per-read overhead. If you have large datasets, prefer larger pages. If you are unsure where to start, 64Mb (before compression) is a good general-purpose page size.","title":"Storage"},{"location":"Deployment/02%20Storage/#storage","text":"","title":"Storage"},{"location":"Deployment/02%20Storage/#folder-structure","text":"","title":"Folder Structure"},{"location":"Deployment/02%20Storage/#datasets","text":"Opteryx references datasets using their relative path as the table name.

This tutorial is only intended to give you an introduction and is not a complete tutorial on SQL. This tutorial is reworked from the DuckDB tutorial. All queries use the internal sample NASA datasets and should work regardless of the data your installation and set up has access to. Concepts Opteryx is a system for querying ad hoc data stored in files as relations . A relation is mathematical term for a data table. Each relation is a named collection of rows, organized in columns, each column should be a common datatype. As an ad hoc query engine, the relations and their schema do not need to be predefined, they are determined at the time the query is run. This is one of the reasons Opteryx cannot be considered a RDBMS (relational database management system), even though it can be used to query data using SQL. Querying Relations To retrieve data from a relation, the relation is queried using a SQL SELECT statement. Basic statements are made of three parts; the list of columns to be returned and the list of relations to retrieve data from, and optional clauses to shape and filter the data that is returned. SELECT * FROM $ planets ; The * is shorthand for \"all columns\", by convention keywords are capitalized, and ; optionally terminates the query. SELECT id , name FROM $ planets WHERE name = 'Earth' ; The output of the above query should be id | name ----+------- 3 | Earth You can write functions, not just simple column references, in the select list. For example, you can write: SELECT id , UPPER ( name ) AS uppercase_name FROM $ planets WHERE id = 3 ; This should give: id | uppercase_name ----+---------------- 3 | EARTH Notice how the AS clause is used to relabel the output column. (The AS clause is optional.) A query can be \u201cqualified\u201d by adding a WHERE clause that specifies which rows are wanted. The WHERE clause contains a Boolean (truth value) expression, and only rows for which the Boolean expression is true are returned. The usual Boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ) are allowed in the qualification. For example, the following the planets with fewer than 10 moons and a day longer than 24 hours: SELECT * FROM $ planets WHERE lengthOfDay > 24 AND numberOfMoons < 10 ; Result: name | lengthOfDay | numberOfMoons --------+-------------+--------------- Mercury | 4222.6 | 0 Venus | 2802 | 0 Mars | 24.7 | 2 Pluto | 153.3 | 5 The order of results are not guaranteed and should not be relied upon. If you request the results of the below query, you might get the Mercury or Venus in either order. Note The same query, of the same data in the same version of Opteryx will likely to return results in the same order, don't expect to test result order non-determinism by rerunning the query millions of times and looking for differences. These differences may manifest over different versions, or from subtle differences to the query statement or data. SELECT name , numberOfMoons FROM $ planets WHERE numberOfMoons = 0 ; Result: name | lengthOfDay | numberOfMoons --------+-------------+--------------- Mercury | 4222.6 | 0 Venus | 2802 | 0 But you\u2019d always get the results shown above if you do: SELECT name , numberOfMoons FROM $ planets WHERE numberOfMoons = 0 ORDER BY name ; You can request that duplicate rows be removed from the result of a query: SELECT DISTINCT planetId FROM $ satellites ; Result: planetId -------- 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Here again, the result row ordering might vary. You can ensure consistent results by using DISTINCT and ORDER BY together: SELECT DISTINCT planetId FROM $ satellites ORDER BY planetId ; Joins Between Relations So far our queries have only accessed one relation at a time. Queries can access multiple relations at once, or access the same relation in such a way that multiple rows of the relation are being processed at the same time. A query that accesses multiple rows of the same or different relations at one time is called a join query. As an example, say you wish to list all the $satellites records together with the planet they orbit. To do that, we need to compare the planetId of each row of the $satellites relation with the id column of all rows in the $planets relation, and return the pairs of rows where these values match. This would be accomplished by the following query: SELECT * FROM $ satellites , $ planets WHERE planetId = $ planets . id ; $satellites.id | planetId | $satellites.name | ... ---------------+----------+------------------+---- 1 | 3 | Moon | 2 | 4 | Phobos | 3 | 4 | Deimos | 4 | 5 | Io | 5 | 5 | Europa | (more rows and columns) Observe two things about the result set: There are no result row for the planets of Mercury or Venus ( planetIds 1 and 2). This is because there is no matching entry in the $satellites relation for these planets, so the join ignores the unmatched rows in the $planets relation. Each of the relations being joined have an id and a name column, to ensure it is clear which relation the value being displayed is from, columns with clashing names are qualified with the relation name. To avoid abiguity and problems in the future if new columns are added to relations, it is good practice to qualify column names in join conditions: SELECT * FROM $ satellites , $ planets WHERE $ satellites . planetId = $ planets . id ; Will return the same result as above, but be more resistant to future failure. Join queries of the kind seen thus far can also be written in this alternative form: SELECT * FROM $ satellites INNER JOIN $ planets ON $ satellites . planetId = $ planets . id ; The Opteryx planner currently uses a different execution strategy for these two similar queries, the explicit INNER JOIN style generally executes faster. Now we will figure out how we can get the Mercury and Venus records back in. What we want the query to do is to scan the $planets relation and for each row to find the matching $satellites row(s). If no matching row is found we want some \u201cempty values\u201d to be substituted for the $satellites relations columns. This kind of query is called an outer join. (The joins we have seen so far are inner joins and cross joins.) The command looks like this: SELECT * FROM $ satellites LEFT OUTER JOIN $ planets ON $ satellites . planetId = $ planets . id ; $satellites.id | planetId | $satellites.name | ... ---------------+----------+------------------+---- | 1 | | | 2 | | 1 | 3 | Moon | 2 | 4 | Phobos | 3 | 4 | Deimos | 4 | 5 | Io | 5 | 5 | Europa | (more rows and columns) Using the LEFT OUTER JOIN will mean the relation mentioned on the left of the join operator will have each of its rows in the output at least once, whereas the relation on the right will only have those rows output that match some row of the left relation. When outputting a left-relation row for which there is no right-relation match, empty (null) values are substituted for the right-relation columns. Note How null values are displayed may be different between different systems, common approaches are to display an empty cell or display 'none' or 'null' in an alternate format (e.g. italics or different font color). This is not controlled by Opteryx. Aggregate Functions Like most query engines and databases, Opteryx supports aggregate functions. An aggregate function computes a single result from multiple input rows. For example, there are aggregates to compute the COUNT , SUM , AVG (average), MAX (maximum) and MIN (minimum) over a set of rows.","title":"SQL Introduction"},{"location":"SQL%20Reference/01%20Introduction/#sql-introduction","text":"","title":"SQL Introduction"},{"location":"SQL%20Reference/01%20Introduction/#overview","text":"This page provides an overview of how to perform simple operations in SQL.

A relation is mathematical term for a data table. Each relation is a named collection of rows, organized in columns, each column should be a common datatype. As an ad hoc query engine, the relations and their schema do not need to be predefined, they are determined at the time the query is run. This is one of the reasons Opteryx cannot be considered a RDBMS (relational database management system), even though it can be used to query data using SQL.","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"SQL%20Reference/01%20Introduction/#querying-relations","text":"To retrieve data from a relation, the relation is queried using a SQL SELECT statement. Basic statements are made of three parts; the list of columns to be returned and the list of relations to retrieve data from, and optional clauses to shape and filter the data that is returned. SELECT * FROM $ planets ; The * is shorthand for \"all columns\", by convention keywords are capitalized, and ; optionally terminates the query. SELECT id , name FROM $ planets WHERE name = 'Earth' ; The output of the above query should be id | name ----+------- 3 | Earth You can write functions, not just simple column references, in the select list. For example, you can write: SELECT id , UPPER ( name ) AS uppercase_name FROM $ planets WHERE id = 3 ; This should give: id | uppercase_name ----+---------------- 3 | EARTH Notice how the AS clause is used to relabel the output column. (The AS clause is optional.) A query can be \u201cqualified\u201d by adding a WHERE clause that specifies which rows are wanted. The WHERE clause contains a Boolean (truth value) expression, and only rows for which the Boolean expression is true are returned. The usual Boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ) are allowed in the qualification. For example, the following the planets with fewer than 10 moons and a day longer than 24 hours: SELECT * FROM $ planets WHERE lengthOfDay > 24 AND numberOfMoons < 10 ; Result: name | lengthOfDay | numberOfMoons --------+-------------+--------------- Mercury | 4222.6 | 0 Venus | 2802 | 0 Mars | 24.7 | 2 Pluto | 153.3 | 5 The order of results are not guaranteed and should not be relied upon.

For example to view the contents of partition SELECT * FROM $ planets FOR YESTERDAY ; This technique is well suited to viewing snapshotted datasets from a previoud point in time.

Note Data must be Mabel partitioned or using a custom partition schema which supports data partitioning. Data returned for previous days with be the latest data as at today. For example if a backfill updates data from seven days ago, when querying that data today the backfilled data will be returned. There is no implicit deduplication of records as they are returned.","title":"Accessing Historical Data"},{"location":"SQL%20Reference/Working%20with%20SQL/10%20Access%20Historical%20Data/#time-travel","text":"You can query dates or date ranges using a FOR clause in your query. For example to view the contents of partition SELECT * FROM $ planets FOR YESTERDAY ; This technique is well suited to viewing snapshotted datasets from a previoud point in time. Uranus was discovered in 1846 and Pluto was discovered in 1930, we could use the FOR clause to query the $planets relation from before that date like this SELECT name FROM $ planets FOR '1846-11-12' ; Which would return name ------- Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Neptune Note The above query is illustrative only demonstrate the concept and do not return these results when actually run.","title":"Time Travel"},{"location":"SQL%20Reference/Working%20with%20SQL/10%20Access%20Historical%20Data/#accumulation","text":"For datasets which are continually added to, such as logs, the FOR clause can be used to quickly filter ranges of records to search over. The FOR clause will most likely record the date the record was written (the SYSTEM_TIME for the record) which may not be the same as the logical or effective date for a record, especially in situations where there is a lag in the records being recorded. The BETWEEN keyword can be used to describe ranges of records, SELECT name FROM $ planets FOR DATES BETWEEN '2021-01-01' and '2022-12-31' ; Note The above query is illustrative only demonstrate the concept and do not return the described results when actually run.","title":"Accumulation"},{"location":"SQL%20Reference/Working%20with%20SQL/10%20Relation%20Constructors/","text":"Relation Constructors Opteryx provides options to create temporary relations as part of query definitions. These relations exist only for the execution of the query that defines them. Using VALUES VALUES allows you to create a multicolumn temporary relation where the values in the relation are explicitly defined in the statement. A simple example is as follows: SELECT * FROM ( VALUES ( 'High' , 3 ), ( 'Medium' , 2 ), ( 'Low' , 1 ) ) AS ratings ( name , rating ); Result: name | rating --------+-------- High | 3 Medium | 2 Low | 1 Using UNNEST UNNEST allows you to create a single column temporary relation where the values in the relation are explicitly defined in the statement. A simple example is as follows: SELECT * FROM UNNEST (( 1 , 2 , 3 )); Result: unnest -------- 1 2 3 Note The values in the UNNEST function are in two sets of parenthesis. The function accepts a list of values, parenthesis is used to wrap parameters to functions and also used to define lists. Using generate_series generate_series allows you to create series by defining the bounds of the series, and optionally, an interval to step between values in the created series. generate_series supports the following variations: Form Types Description generate_series(stop) NUMERIC Generate a NUMERIC series between 1 and 'stop', with a step of 1 generate_series(start, stop) NUMERIC, NUMERIC Generate a NUMERIC series between 'start' and 'stop', with a step of 1 generate_series(start, stop, step) NUMERIC, NUMERIC, NUMERIC Generate a NUMERIC series between 'start' and 'stop', with an explicit step size generate_series(start, stop, interval) TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL Generate a TIMESTAMP series between 'start' and 'stop', with a given interval generate_series(cidr) VARCHAR Generate set of IP addresses from a given CIDR (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24 ) Single Parameter Example (NUMERIC): SELECT * FROM generate_series ( 3 ) generate_series ---------------- 1 2 3 Single Parameter Example (VARCHAR): SELECT * FROM generate_series ( '192.168.1.0/30' ) generate_series ---------------- 192.168.1.0 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3 Two parameter Example: SELECT * FROM generate_series ( 2 , 4 ) generate_series ---------------- 2 3 4 Three parameter NUMERIC Example: SELECT * FROM generate_series ( - 5 , 5 , 5 ) generate_series ---------------- -5 0 5 Three parameter TIMESTAMP example: SELECT * FROM generate_series ( '2020-01-01' , '2025-12-31' , '1y' ) generate_series ---------------- 2020-01-01 00:00 2021-01-01 00:00 2022-01-01 00:00 2023-01-01 00:00 2024-01-01 00:00 2025-01-01 00:00 Interval Definitions Intervals are defined quantifying one or more periods which make up the interval, supported periods and their notation are: Period Symbol Years y Months mo Weeks w Days d Hours h Minutes m Seconds s Where required, periods can be combined to define more complex intervals, for example 1h30m represents one hour and 30 minutes.
